# Getting Started with Project

This project is just a playground that has a purpose to sharpen my skills in React, React-Redux, Redux-Saga, and MUI5. It should grow with time, with more complex features, and maybe adding real server (it uses for now json-server)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Run the project:
### `npm start`

Run the json server:
### `npm run server`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
Open [http://localhost:5000/users](http://localhost:5000/users) to view json server data in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
